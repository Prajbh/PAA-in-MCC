# PAA-in-MCC

This project provides the privacy aware authentication (PAA) for mobile cloud computing. 
For security PAA identity based signature scheme is used. 
To improve security level, we have proposed a password-based authentication schemes.
Then for more security, we use the encryption and decryption process using Attribute Based Encryption Scheme (ABE).
In this scheme, a file can be accessed by using the private key only.
By using the private key, after getting access for the file, user can download the particular file and it can be saved 
in the local system.



To execute 
first run the home.java file (this user is the client)
choose to upload a file when prompted
Again run home.java file( this will act as the server)
choose to download the file when prompted

This project is also implemented using dropbox
